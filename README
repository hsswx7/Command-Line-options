_________________How to Use__________________________________
Please use the commands: 

exe = executable : proj1

-----commands-----
-h or -help  : shows steps on how to use the program
-nx        : changes the value of x
-lfilename : change the log file name 

-----examples------
proj1-h -help -lfilename.txt -n32342 
proj1 -h -help -l filename2.txt -n32423 

----or ---
proj1  // this was done to simply test proj1 without the 

Wirting an invalid commands returns 0 and terminates the program -> program writes nothing to the logfile.txt

---------Bugs with commands---------
If you do -lfilename-nx this producess and error
if you do -l-n it will name the file -n, I tried checking for -n but not matter -
what type of if statement would detect that its -n but it does not work.            
proj1 noncommands, simply runs proj1. proj1 random chars simply runs the programs | ex: proj1 eiafod.

*******************Wiriting To File********************************************

- When making a filename Please write it the name with .txt
-If .txt is not added the file will still be Written onto the new name.

-fopen I did use "a" , this allows multiple runs of the of proj1 and stored in the same file.
********************************************************************************


*********Time****************************************************************
I have displayed nanoseconds by adding seconds*BILLION + nanoseconds. 
I have commented out ctime which i prefer.
